Usage: python scrub_bucket_rados.py [BUCKET_NAME] [NUM_OF_THREADS -- optional] [BASE_TIER_POOL -- optional] [CACHE_TIER_POOL -- optional] [CONF_FILE_PATH -- optional]

Parameters:
BUCKET_NAME	 - Pass the name of the bucket that has to be scrubbed
NUM_OF_THREADS   - Number of threads that will be used for scrubbing the bucket
		   Default value: 20
BASE_TIER_POOL	 - Name of the base tier pool. Objects are searched in base tier if they
		   are not present in cache tier.
		   Default value: .in-chennai-1.rgw.buckets
CACHE_TIER_POOL  - Name of the cache tier pool. Objects are searched in cache tier first.
		   Default value: .in-chennai-1.rgw.buckets.cache
CONF_FILE_PATH   - Path of conf file. This is needed for authentication purposes.
		   Default value: /home/rajagopal.s/scrub/conf/prod-d42sa/ceph.conf

Examples:
  python scrub_bucket_rados.py dss-hnh05012018 -> This will scrub bucket 'dss-hnh05012018' using 20 (default num) of threads

Note:
Fixing authentication related errors:-
For connecting to cluster, this scrubber uses monitor's keyring file. Keyring file has to be mentioned in the conf file. To fix, follow these steps
1) Copy keyring ring from monitor (/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring) to conf/<cluster_name>/ 
2) Add "keyring" field to conf/<cluster_name>/ceph.conf
